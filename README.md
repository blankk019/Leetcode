Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) + LeetCode Solutions

Welcome! 👋
This repository contains my personal study material and solutions for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and LeetCode problems, mainly implemented in C# (with some notes/examples in other languages when useful).

📑 Contents

✅ Study Notes

Key concepts from Data Structures & Algorithms.

Explanations of important patterns (sliding window, hashing, prefix sums, etc.).

✅ LeetCode Solutions

Clean, commented C# solutions.

Organized by topic (Arrays, Hashing, Strings, etc.).

✅ Complexity Analysis

Time and space complexity explained for each solution.

🛠 Languages & Tools

C# / .NET (main implementation)

Python (sometimes for pseudocode / quick testing)

Git + GitHub for version control

🎯 Goals

Strengthen understanding of DSA fundamentals.

Practice LeetCode / interview problems.

Build a reference repo for future revisions.
